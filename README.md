# daily-docket

Create the basic structure for the todo app:

- Add a header with the app title "My Todo List" 
- Include a main content area that will contain the todo list
- Add a footer with your name as the creator
- In the main content area, add an input field where the user can type a new todo
- Also add an "Add" button next to the input. Clicking it won't do anything yet.
- Use a clean, simple design with a white background and pastel colors for the header/footer. Use a sans-serif font.
